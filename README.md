# Age-and-Gender-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting gender and age using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technique.

# Overview
The Gender and Age Prediction project utilizes CNN to predict gender and age based on input data. The CNN model is trained on a dataset to learn patterns and make accurate predictions.

# Dataset
Kaggle Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new

# Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture includes multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by dense layers for prediction. The model is trained to optimize the prediction accuracy for both gender and age.

# Usage
